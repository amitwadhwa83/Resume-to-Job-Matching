# Resume to Job Matcher
This is an **experimental AI system** that matches resumes to job descriptions using **Machine Learning & NLP**.  

## Description
This project is a Python application that matches resumes to job descriptions using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 
It helps recruiters and job seekers by automating the process of finding the best job-resume matches.

## Features
- Resume parsing: Extracts relevant information from resumes.
- Job description analysis: Analyzes job descriptions to identify key requirements.
- Matching algorithm: Uses NLP to match resumes with job descriptions based on skills, experience, and other criteria.
- 
## 🔹 How AI is Transforming Job Matching  
- AI can **predict job matches** based on historical data.  
- This project uses **past job-role mappings** to suggest relevant jobs.  
- Future enhancements: **Web scraping** to fetch real-time job data. 

## 🔹 Tools & Libraries Used 🛠️  
- **Machine Learning:** Sentence Transformers, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF  
- **Development:** PyCharm, Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Deployment:** GitHub, Streamlit, Hugging Face Spaces 

## 🔹 Live Demo 🌍

- [Streamlit App](https://resumetojobmatching.streamlit.app/)  

## 🔹 How to Use It?  
1. **Upload your resume** OR enter job-related skills manually.  
2. The AI will suggest **matching job roles** based on past data.  
3. Future versions will recommend **missing skills** to improve job prospects.
